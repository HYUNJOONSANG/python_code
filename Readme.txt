I developed k-nearest neighbors, conformal prediction based on Nearest Neighbour, and conformal prediction lasso regression. 
As well, I developed conformal K-fold program. 

these codes were developed by python.
Additionally, these files is for jupyter notebook. 


First, in KNN_conformal.ipynb, you can check KNN algorithm and conformal prediction based on Nearest Neighbour 

second, in lasso_conformal.ipynb, this file includes lasso algorithm and conformal prediction based on LASSO

last, in normalization_SVM.ipynh, this file contains svm code using sample data and each normalization function as well as k-fold function
